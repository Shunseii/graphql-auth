# graphql-auth
A boilerplate for an Express GraphQL API that stores user data in MongoDB and implements authentication and authorization using sessions stored in Redis, all integrated with Typescript. It uses decoraters provided by Typegoose and Typegraphql together to automatically generate type definitions, mongoose models, and an SDL schema file from a single source of truth.
